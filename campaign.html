                <h2>Charles de Marcs</h2>
                <p>Charles de Marcs was born on December 30, 1979 into a wealthy French family in KJ Island when his family was on vacation there. Afterwards, he moved back to France in Nice and was raised as a well behaved child, and he got near-perfect grades in school. When he turned 18, he moved to Paris to get a PHD in political science in the UniversitÃ© de Paris. He then immigrated back into Toyland, and he then joined the Toyland Communist Party. He was elected into the House of Representatives, and then in the Senate. After his terms in Congress, he was elected leader of the TCP by his colleagues. Now, he strongly believes in Communism and is running for president of Toyland to fulfill his dream of bringing upon a Communist Toyland.</p>

                <h2 class="text-right">Louis LÃ©nine</h2>
                <p class="text-right">Louis LÃ©nine was born on April 4, 1986 in Bordeaux, France, where he lived in until he moved to Toyland. He was also raised well and got good grades in school. He didn't go to college until he was 20, and he got a bachelors in economics. When he turned 26, he decided to work in Toyland as an economist, and eventually he turned to politics. Once he became a citizen of the nation, he ran for office in the House of Representatives under the Toyland Communist Party. So far, he has served two terms, and is running as vice president under Charles de Marcs now. He believes that the economics of capitalism isn't sustainable and could easily be abused by big corporations, and firmly believes that Communism will help the economy now and forever.</p>

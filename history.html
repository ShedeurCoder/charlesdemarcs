        <h1 class="text-center">Our History</h1>
        <div class="px-2">
            <h2>Our founding</h2>
            <p>We were founded on April 12, 1951, during the Cold War between the US and the Soviet Union. Our founder, Russian immigrant Rodya Kovalchuk, was just 29 years old when he created the party. He believed in a Communist society like his original homeland. He created the party to gather Communists around Toyland to fight as one for the Communist Agenda. He made the party run in every election ever since, mid term and general.</p>

            <img src="images/kovalchuk.png" alt="Last known image of Kovalchuk" class="float-left w-25 mr-2">
            <h2>Our founder</h2>
            <p>Rodya Kovalchuk was born in Volgograd, Russia (later to be renamed to Stalingrad) in January 4, 1921. He was raised there by his mother, as his father worked in Moscow as a Bolshevik. He was raised as a Bolshevik, learning great things about the party, and how great Communism and his country was. Eventually, he moved to Moscow to pursue government. Unfortunately, when he was just 18 years old, the joint invasion of Poland by the Soviets and the Germans happened, and he had to serve in Poland. Fortunately, he survived and was trained further, for he was on of the best soldiers on the field. When he was 21, he was ordered to the battle of Stalingrad. He knew that he had to defend his hometown for his motherland. After fierce battling, he was one of the few who actually made it to the end. In 1945, after Germany surrendered, Kovalchuk immigrated to Toyland to live a more peaceful life. There, he and his cheekbones founded the Toyland Communist Party.</p>

        <div class="px-2">
            <h2>The revolution</h2>
            <p>The revolution of 1956 in Toyland was a great demonstration of how powerful the TCP is, even though we lost. Our party was led by Kovalchuk himself through the states of Toyland. We were through dangerous terrain and had unbeatable courage. We took every state except for Toy Central State in less than six months, even though we had only 10% of the amount of men the Toyland army had. We took about half of TCS, before Kovalchuk died in the battle of Badena, Toy Central State on September 4, 1956. Afterwards, the elites in our party couldn't decide who would be his successor, causing us to become weak and having the Toyland army defeat us. But, even though we were defeated by force, we were never defeated, as we kept trying. We won multiple seats in the House and the Senate. We kept going and pushing for Communism, honoring Kovalchuk who helped us get here.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="px-2">
            <h2>Us now</h2>
            <p>Now, the TCP honors Kovalchuk, the one who started it all. We honor him and our current leader, Charles de Marcs, as they help us keep trying. Currently, we have one seat in the house, and right now polls are predicting that we will double that next general election. With our current leader, Charles de Marcs, and House member, Louis LÃ©nine running as President and Vice president, we can expect to have a Communist utopia.</p>
